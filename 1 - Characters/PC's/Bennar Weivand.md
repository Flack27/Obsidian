### Pc Backstory
Amdry Brackstom was born in Noxus to a relatively modest family known for their masonry and craftsmanship. He had many brothers and sisters, most of whom joined the Warmasons guild. However, Amdry had been enamoured by the pounding of leather and the melody of steel-on-steel since an early age. He joined the military enrolment program and trained until his resolve was strong and his will unbreakable. Eventually Amdry became a Wardrummer, an often overlooked and mocked profession, but Amdry revelled in it.
Amdry lived the life of a devout soldier in the Noxian military. Drummers are the voice with which the empire inspires its warriors and intimidates its foes, and as such must truly embody and believe Noxus’s values. Strength above all; every soldier worth their weight; through war we create unity and prosperity. The only thing of note that does not conform to the stereotypical ideal of a Noxian soldier was Amdry’s obsession with history and what we can learn from our past. He would have discussions with anyone willing to lend an ear and he incorporated much of his findings in his frontline speeches.
His family shared little of his interests, but what he lacked in regard from his siblings was made up by the attention Anita conDoin gave him, daughter of General Erlind. They often spent time reading in the libraries of the Immortal Bastion, playing music in taverns to earn a few coppers, and wiling away the days with his fellow soldiers or her higher class friends. Amdry even attended a noble party as Anita’s chaperone. For the first time in his life his family listened attentively to what he had to tell during that year’s Snowdown. That next year, he received his first mission.
When Captain Corinna Clasven informed her Warband they were to join the invasion of Ionia, Amdry was more than prepared to cross the ocean between them and their prize. His family had a hand in the scouting missions under Boram Darkwill, and he was eager to join his brethren in their work and glory. Not a mere lad anymore, just shy of twenty years, he first set foot on unknown shores. Battles were fought, blood was shed, land was conquered. The invasion went well.
Early on in the war, Amdry’s Warband was sent to investigate and aid any survivors of an attack on a nearby village housed between a trio of mountains. However, these mountains were sundered and all survivors, be they Ionian or Noxian, held conflicting accounts on what happened. All saw the light, and all felt the rumble. Some had felt awe, others disgust. Demons had roamed the battlefield, the shadows of the fallen had risen against their allies, and spirits had shone in the stars to rescue the few of them that were left. The survivors were put to work the next day.
Alone and in a half-burned forest in the cradle of the mountain trio, Amdry saw the visage of a certain being. Curious, he followed it through woodland and ash, but sooner rather than later he had lost his prey. The only thing he found beyond dust and bone was a clay chime buried in the ground, glowing a dull yellow. He hung it around his neck and returned to his comrades, not thinking much of his near miss with the Wandering Caretaker.
Over time, as if a soft voice had planted itself inside his mind, Amdry began contemplating his prior actions and slowly but surely doubts took root in his mind. Doubts he dare not bring up in his discussions. His voice was still as loud and his pounding still as strong, yet his fervour had all but gone. The others seemed not to notice though. Words alone were apparently enough to satiate their desires for warmongering and quell any of the doubts they had in their actions. Amdry’s doubts would only deepen the more he clamoured and bellowed. And the horrors Noxus had resigned themselves to deploy in order to keep a chance of victory alive only heightened his disgust.
When Captain Corinna Clasven informed her Warband they were to return to Noxus, Amdry was more than prepared to cross the ocean once more. In his absence, Noxus had changed, and not for the better. The invasion had taken its toll on the people of Noxus, the signs of which he had seen in Ionia. The poor were starving while scraps were sent overseas; children were set to work with similar hours as fully grown men; and people were revolting throughout the nation in protest.
Still, Amdry was glad to return to home soil, and slightly optimistic that all would turn out for the better. He could see his family again, or what remained of it after the war. Perhaps he might visit Anita and play before a crowd of drunkards. The worst of the war he had left behind surely. Back home all would be well, he thought as the salty sprays flecked his cheeks and the sun shone as bright as the day he had left. How foolish he was to think so.
On its arrival, Amdry’s Warhost was immediately sent to alleviate “internal affairs” as General Granth put it. What he meant were the skirmishes near Nockmirch, the expansions into Urzeris and Tereshni, the clash beyond the Delverhold and the Battle of Basilich. Amdry’s Warband was sent to crush the uprisings in the Rokrund Plains. Noxus was still bound by blood it seemed, even in its own borders. All must yield to strength or succumb to it. Nightmares kept him awake, yet hope in something better kept him dreaming.
So conflicted was he, that Amdry despaired enough to voice his own thoughts for a change. Repression by force leads to rebellion by force. Strength wielded without compassion is wrought with evil when those in power only want more of it. A nation built on warfare can never attain peace in itself. It must always insist itself as dominant. As the only option. But there were more options. He had seen so in the eyes of his comrades and foes, who faced their fears together. And in the comradery they had shared despite their deeds.
Most of his comrades showed him then why strength was still king. Amdry tried to resign, and was rejected. So he defected, but was dragged back to finish his service. He threatened to kill Clasven, yet when she found out she only laughed. His comrades looked at him with contempt, anger, pity and a mix of all three. In the end he had nothing left to lose. Nothing but his own life.
He had wanted to make a statement. He had planned to keep the damage to himself. He had resorted to show them with strength. The battle was already won anyway. The prisoners that could work were being shackled and those that resisted were made ready for execution. Clasven’s face was most priceless of all. Pure fear. They would tell of his death far and wide. Mayhaps even Darkwill would be told of his deed. If it even made a dent in the war machine that was Noxus, it would be worth it. He foresaw a nation built on something better. What he didn’t foresee was the enormity of the explosion he rigged.
Amdry woke up in a pile of rubble and blood. A giant scar, already healed, ran over his right eye and shrapnel was caught throughout his entire body. It hurt to move and stand up, but he survived. The chime on his neck was glowing a bright gold, which soon faded into an even duller yellow than before. Amdry looked at his fallen comrades and the destruction he left behind. Guilt washed over him. He couldn’t move or look away, no matter how hard he tried. This was his doing. He didn’t know how long he stood there, but eventually the exhaustion got to him. All he wished for was sweet oblivion to wash over him. So he left the site behind and fell asleep in a scorched land under rumbling skies.
He arose some time later, wet and aching, with even more shame than before. Before him stood a party of concerned individuals that had come to investigate the blast that occurred two days prior. They gave him food and water, a set of clothes, and an escort to the nearby city of Qualthala. Amdry was at a loss for words and so only said little of what he knew. What he did say, was through the identity he had planned to adopt during his first defection. Bennar Weivand was a traveling bard and refugee of the recent Noxian war campaign in Rokrund, who left his home and life behind because he was afraid to arrive back at nothing. He had no home no more, just a road and a fiddle. Any hints of military training he would ascribe to joining rebellious groups against the empire in his youth, none of which had lasted. He had been captured by Captain Corinna Clasven and was made ready for execution when a sudden explosion relieved him of that fate. Luckily the party didn’t ask much further than his name and occupation and said to report to a commanding officer when he reached the city. However, Bennar didn’t do so. He has remained in Qualthala ever since, wallowing in misery and aimlessness. If only he could bring the relief he himself, his comrades and his nation so deeply deserved and required.
