### Pc Backstory
Mukai grew up in a mountain village in the north-east of Ionia. His life was simple and quaint, and he hated every second of it. He grew bored of working in the farms with his father, and longed for excitement. When an old martial artist named Master Shun traveled through his village looking for pupils, Mukai discovered something worth living for: the thrill of battle. Without hesitation, he left his old village behind as Master Shun took him in.

They traveled to Shun's monastery, where Mukai started his training alongside several others. To Mukai's dismay, he didn't seem to perform above his peers. He wasn't performing badly, but there were several students who seemed much more talented than he did.

Frustrated, he turned to Shun's library, looking for insight and possible ways to overcome his peers. He learned much, but again it was not enough to put him above his fellow students.

One late night, while exploring the deepest sections of the library, Mukai discovered a **locked research chamber** that Shun clearly didn't want students to find. Using his knowledge of the monastery's layout, he managed to break in. Inside, he found Advanced lesson" that Shun was hiding from his students. He ignored all the warnings about corruption and focused only on the power described in the annotations.

Greedily, he started reading and practicing the contents. Within less than two hours, Master Shun rushed into the chamber, clearly distressed. He scolded Mukai, explaining that this wasn't hidden power but **dangerous corruption** that he was researching to help heal others.

Shun revealed he had been contacted by masters across Runeterra about similar problems - students corrupted by emotional manipulation techniques. His research was meant to find ways to reverse the damage, not teach the techniques.

He forbade Mukai from ever using what he had learned again. Shun secured his research more carefully and punished Mukai by making him meditate for a week, in a location slightly outside of the monastery grounds.

Mukai had however already learned some of the fundamentals of emotional manipulation, and it was corrupting his life energy. He spent the week secretly practicing what he had learned, discarding his master's warnings as weakness and hypocrisy.

The corruption festered inside him, and over the week he felt growing anger and resentment towards his master. How dare Shun research this power but refuse to use it? How could he call it dangerous when it felt so strong?

When he finished his punishment, he felt like a different man. He was going to continue practicing these techniques in secret, and eventually defeat Master Shun when he had fully mastered them. He would prove that Shun's fear of real power was nothing but weakness.

Mukai's return was spoiled. Mourning students told Mukai that Master Shun had been killed by a mysterious warrior. But this wasn't a normal defeat in battle - Shun had died protecting his research from someone who wanted to destroy all traces of it.

The killer had taken most of Shun's research archive, leaving behind only destruction and death. Mukai's anger boiled. His chance to prove himself was taken away. More importantly, the knowledge that could have made him powerful was now in the hands of his master's killer.

But Mukai still carried the fundamental techniques in his head - the corrupted knowledge that The Severing Hand would eventually hunt him for possessing. Mukai asked for what little details the surviving students could provide about the killer, packed his things, and set off to find this mysterious warrior. Being the one who bested his old master, this killer was now his target. He was going to prove himself one way or another - and reclaim the power that was rightfully his.
