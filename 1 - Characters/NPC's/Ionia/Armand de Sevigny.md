## GM Notes

**Internal Conflict:** Armand genuinely believes that Guy is trying to do the right thing.

**Good Person, Bad Situation:** He is fundamentally decent - would never harm innocent people. He represents the good people who get caught up in morally ambiguous causes.

**Military Honor:** His concept of duty and honor is genuine. He followed Guy not out of fear of punishment, but because he truly believed it was the right thing to do for Noxus.

**Humanizing Guy:** Armand's presence shows that Guy isn't entirely evil - good people can believe in him. This makes Guy more complex than a simple villain.
