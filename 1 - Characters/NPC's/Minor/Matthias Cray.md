## Background

Matthias Cray is an advisor who works as [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]]'s agent to destabilize [[Quathala]] and make it vulnerable to Guy's takeover. He presents himself as Baron [[Roderick Voss]]'s "trusted" advisor, but manipulates the Baron's paranoia and poor judgment to ensure the region appears weak and mismanaged. After successfully completing his mission in Quathala, Guy promotes him and brings him to the Immortal Bastion as captain of his secret police.

## Appearance & Mannerisms

- **Age:** 35 years old
- **Race:** Human (Noxian commoner)
- **Appearance:** Sharp features with a thin smile that never reaches his eyes
- **Speech Pattern:** Honey-sweet words when manipulating, cold and cruel when in power
- **Notable Features:** Slimy smile that becomes a cruel sneer when he has authority

## Campaign Story

### The Military Advice (Chapter 1-2)

Convinces Roderick NOT to request reinforcements:
- "Requesting troops shows weakness to the capital"
- "Other barons will see it as failure to maintain order"
- "Guy du Bas-Tyra is watching for any sign you can't hold your domain"
- "Better to solve local problems with local solutions"

### Stonewall Scheme (Chapter 1-2)

Suggested hiring "outsiders" rather than requesting military aid - makes Roderick look weak while keeping him compliant with Noxian law

### The Deed Encouragement (Chapter 2)

When Roderick has idea to give party the village deed instead of paying, Matthias encourages: "Very clever, my lord - reward their service without depleting the treasury!"

### Promotion and Departure (Chapter 3)

After successfully destabilizing Quathala, Guy rewards Matthias with promotion to captain of his secret police and brings him to the Immortal Bastion

### Left in Command (Chapter 5)

When Guy must leave the Immortal Bastion to crush a rebellion in the west, he takes his military commanders like [[Armand de Sevigny]] with him but leaves Matthias in charge of finding and capturing [[Anita conDoin]] even tho he might note be perfectly fit for the role.

### The Overzealous Captain (Chapter 5)

With Guy gone and power in his hands, Matthias becomes dangerously overzealous:
- Hunts Anita and the party through the capital streets
- Uses brutal tactics and secret police methods
- Makes decisions beyond his authority in his panic to succeed
- Creates the brutal chase sequences that force the party underground

### Death or Defeat (Chapter 6)

Either dies during the party's escape or survives but loses everything when Swain's coup succeeds

## Character Arc

- Master of false concern and honey words

### Phase 2 - The Ambitious Servant (Immortal Bastion)

### Phase 3 - The Overzealous Tyrant (Guy's Absence)
- Left in charge of finding Anita

- His cruelty exceeds even Guy's methods
## Secret Police Methods (Immortal Bastion Phase)

**The Hunt:**

## Lore & Connections

- [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]] - His master and patron
- [[Roderick Voss]] - The Baron he manipulated
- [[Quathala]] - Where he earned his promotion
- [[Anita conDoin]] - His target at the Immortal Bastion
- [[Armand de Sevigny]] - The honorable captain who goes with Guy (contrast to Matthias)
- [[Erlind conDoin]] - May be involved in his imprisonment decisions
- [[Immortal Bastion]] - Where his cruelty is unleashed

## GM Notes

**Character Evolution:** Matthias transforms from manipulative advisor to brutal secret police captain, showing how power corrupts opportunists. In Quathala he was slimy but subtle; at the Bastion he becomes openly cruel.

**The Panic Factor:** When the party helps Anita escape, Matthias panics knowing Guy will punish failure. His desperation makes him even more dangerous and cruel.
