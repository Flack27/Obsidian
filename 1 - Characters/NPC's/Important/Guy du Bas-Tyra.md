## Quick Reference

**Status:** Alive (currently Duke of Basilich) 
**Location:** Rockrund 
**Relationship:** Complicated Enemy (noble goals, terrible methods) 
**Key Trait:** Brilliant tactician

## Background

Guy du Bas-Tyra is one of Noxus' most brilliant military tacticians and ambitious noble with genuine intentions to save his homeland from decay. He believes that the costly war with Ionia is destroying Noxus and wants to replace Boram Darkwill as Grand General. His extensive plan: While Darkwill is in Ionia, Erlind has command as highest ranking commander. Guy wants control over the entire south by gaining ownership of Rockrund (already obtained) and Stonewall (via Matthias' manipulation). This would give him control over Quathala, making him the most powerful commander and thereby command over the realm. When the party won't give up Stonewall, he must resort to "force" - he imprisons Roderick and forces him to appoint Guy as Lord Regent of Quathala. With this title and southern control, he goes to the Immortal Bastion for the rest of his plan.

## GM Notes

**Guy's Strategic Plan:**

**Phase 1 - Southern Consolidation:** Already gained control over Rockrund, used Matthias to claim Stonewall via manipulation of Roderick. These two territories would give him a claim over Quathala.

**Phase 2 - Political Maneuvering:** With Darkwill in Ionia, Erlind has command as highest ranking general. Guy's southern control would make him the most powerful commander, giving him effective command over the realm.

**Phase 3 - Marriage Alliance:** Marrying Anita would strengthen his political position and neutralize Erlind's influence, clearing his path to Grand General.

**The Complication:** Party's control over Stonewall forced him to a more direct approach - imprisoning Roderick and forcing him to appoint Guy as Lord Regent of Quathala.
