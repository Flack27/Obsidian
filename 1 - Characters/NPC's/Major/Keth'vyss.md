## Background

Keth'vyss was once a brilliant Ascended scholar of Shurima, specialized in portal magic and Valheru technology. He studied interdimensional travel and wanted to defend Runeterra by using this knowledge. When Icathia fell, he became a Darkin but retained his sanity and noble goals. However, centuries of imprisonment by Zoe have broken his mind. Now he still believes he must save the world from the Void, but his methods have become insane - he opens Void portals to "study" them, precisely what the enemy wants.

## Appearance & Mannerisms

- **Age:** Ancient (Ascended/Darkin)
- **Race:** Darkin (formerly Ascended)
- **Appearance:** Zilean's body but with Darkin corruption - glowing eyes, dark energy
- **Speech Pattern:** Academic but insane, speaks about "salvation" and "research"
- **Notable Features:** Constant internal struggle between Zilean and Keth'vyss consciousness

## Campaign Story

### Defeat of Celesta (Pre-campaign)

Zilean let Keth'vyss take over his body to defeat Celesta

### Flight to Ionia (Current)

Fled to Ionia to search for Valheru remnants

### Corruption Activities (Planned)

Opens a Void portal for "research"

### Future Confrontation (Planned)

Party will have to stop him before his madness destroys Ionia

## Lore & Connections

- [[Zilean]] - His current host body
- [[Celesta]] - Was defeated by their fusion
- [[Valheru]] - Obsessed with their technology
- [[Ionia]] - Current operation location

## GM Notes

**Internal Conflict:** Zilean's consciousness constantly fights against Keth'vyss' control. This leads to unpredictable behavior and moments when Zilean temporarily breaks through.

**Ironic Tragedy:** He thinks he's the hero but does exactly what the Void wants. Every portal he opens to "study" makes the Void invasion worse.

**Research Obsession:** Seeks ancient Valheru artifacts and knowledge, corrupts sacred Ionian sites to use the magical energy for his experiments.

**Noble but Mad:** His original motivations were noble - protect Runeterra. But imprisonment has driven him insane and his methods are now destructive.

**Future Arc:** Eventually Celesta will try to assimilate him for his portal-opening powers. This will enable the final confrontation at the Lifestone.
