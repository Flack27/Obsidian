## Background

Guy du Bas-Tyra is one of Noxus' most brilliant military tacticians and ambitious noble with genuine intentions to save his homeland from decay. He believes that the costly war with Ionia is destroying Noxus and wants to replace Boram Darkwill as Grand General. When the opportunity presents itself through regional instability, he seizes it to demonstrate his leadership and expand his influence.

## Appearance & Mannerisms

- **Age:** 42 years old
- **Race:** Human (Noxian nobility)
- **Appearance:** Distinguished with graying temples, always perfectly dressed, cold calculating eyes
- **Speech Pattern:** Eloquent and persuasive, but with subtle threatening undertones
- **Notable Features:** Aristocratic bearing that radiates power and privilege

## Campaign Story

### The Opportunity (Pre-Campaign/Chapter 1)

Rockrund rebellion and Quathala's instability provide perfect moment to expand influence while Darkwill is in Ionia

### Rockrund Consolidation (Background)

Helps suppress rebellion, gains respect and foothold in the region

### Quathala Takeover (Chapter 2-3)

"Stabilizes" Quathala while Roderick struggles with undermanned garrison and poor leadership - takes control of the region

### The Immortal Bastion (Chapter 4-5)

With expanded influence, heads to capital to marry [[Anita conDoin]] and cement his position as replacement for Darkwill

### Swain's Counter-Coup (Chapter 6)

While Guy executes his plan, Swain stages his coup and becomes Grand General

### Exile in Ionia (Act 2)

Guy becomes refugee in Ionia, begins his redemption arc

## Guy's Strategic Plan

**Phase 1 - Seizing the Opportunity:**
- Rockrund rebellion provides chance to demonstrate leadership
- Quathala's instability (undermanned garrison, weak baron) allows him to "stabilize" the region
- NOT about specific territories - about showing he can lead where Darkwill cannot
- Demonstrates strength and competence while Grand General is absent in Ionia

**Phase 2 - Political Consolidation:**
- With influence expanded through successful "stabilization," moves to Immortal Bastion
- Marries Anita to strengthen political position and neutralize Erlind's influence
- Positions himself as viable replacement for Darkwill
- Uses legal mechanisms and political pressure rather than open rebellion

**Phase 3 - The Ultimate Goal:**
- Replace Darkwill as Grand General
- End the costly Ionian war
- Reform Noxus according to his vision

## Lore & Connections

- [[Matthias Cray]] - His agent who manipulated Roderick
- [[Roderick Voss]] - Victim of his consolidation strategy
- [[Armand de Sevigny]] - His loyal companion
- [[Anita conDoin]] - The woman he wanted to force into marriage
- [[Basilich]] - His original domain and power base
- [[Immortal Bastion]] - Where he will stage his political play
- [[Swain]] - The one who will ultimately thwart his plan
- [[Ionia]] - Where he will ultimately seek exile

## GM Notes

**Guy's Philosophy:**
- Genuinely believes Noxus needs better leadership
- Sees the Ionian war as bleeding the nation dry
- Willing to use any means necessary for what he sees as the greater good
- Views individuals as pieces in a larger game

**The Complication:**
- Party's involvement is largely incidental to his plans
- Anita's escape and Erlind's death are setbacks, but not deal-breakers
- Swain's counter-coup is what ultimately defeats him, not the party's actions

**Redemption Arc Setup:**
- His exile to Ionia will force him to live among people he once saw as conquered subjects
- Must build genuine relationships rather than political alliances
- Will prove his leadership capability through protection rather than domination

**Character Complexity:**
- Not evil, but ruthlessly pragmatic
- Destroys lives for political goals he genuinely believes are noble
- His methods are terrible, but his diagnosis of Noxus' problems is accurate
