## Background

Ashen-Shugar was the only [[Valheru]] who chose to remain on Runeterra during the Chaos War. Where his kin were willing to destroy the world for dominance, he stopped the [[Lifestone]] activation by killing the leading Valheru. This choice went against all Valheru nature - he felt emotions and connections that his race should not know. In reality, he was already influenced by the temporal paradox of his future fusion with a party member. After the war he died, but his essence was captured in his weapon and armor. Through Zilean's intervention, his sword ended up in the ancient caves beneath the Immortal Bastion with the dying dragon Rhuagh.

- [[Chaos War]] - The conflict in which he made his choice
- [[Lifestone]] - The weapon he stopped from activation

- [[Watchers]] - The corrupted Valheru he indirectly created
- [[Rhuagh]] - The dragon who carried his sword to the party

## GM Notes

**The Temporal Paradox:** Ashen-Shugar's emotions and choices arose from his future fusion with Marduun. He was never fully only a Valheru - he was always already a mix of both identities. However, even he didn't understand why he felt different during the Chaos War.

**Fusion Mechanics:**


- Physical transformation: eyes, bearing, presence become more Valheru
- Develops into battle trances
- Begins with visions of the past during travel to Ionia
- Risk that Ashen-Shugar temporarily gains dominance in Ionia
- Ends in complete fusion where both identities become one

**Memory Suppression:** The most crucial memories about the Lifestone creation, the true reason for his betrayal, and why the Watchers hate him are mysteriously locked away. These can only be unlocked by Zilean's temporal magic after he's freed and studies the timeline.

**Zilean's Role:** Zilean influenced the dragon to bring the sword to the right place, but didn't understand the full significance. Only after his liberation will he discover the paradox and be able to unlock the final memories.

**The Mystery Unfolds:** Neither Zilean nor Ashen-Shugar fully understood the temporal loop when they made their crucial decisions. The complete truth will only become clear through their mutual revelations in Act 3.
