## Background

The Severing Hand is an ancient being whose true name and origins have been forgotten even by themselves. They have dedicated centuries to hunting demons that feed on emotions and any mortals who practice techniques that blur the line between human and demon. To them, emotional manipulation arts are a corruption that must be completely eradicated - not controlled, not studied, but eliminated entirely.

## Multi-Form Nature 
**The True Body:** 
- Location unknown, possibly hidden in a remote sanctuary 
- Contains the original consciousness and memories
- Only emerges for the most dangerous targets 
- Immensely powerful but cautious about direct exposure 

**Hunter Manifestations:** 
- Weaker extensions of the main consciousness
- Can be created and dismissed as needed
- Specialize in tracking, reconnaissance, and eliminating lesser threats
- Share memories with the true body but operate semi-independently
- Multiple can be active simultaneously across different regions 

**Manifestation Abilities:**
- Each hunter form can sense emotional corruption within several miles
- Communicate telepathically with the true body
- Retain core combat abilities but at reduced power
- If destroyed, memories return to true body but creation is taxing
## Appearance & Nature

- **Age:** Ancient (exact age unknown, possibly centuries old)
- **Race:** Unknown (may have once been human but changed by their crusade)
- **Appearance:** Tall, gaunt figure wrapped in dark traveling robes
- **Speech Pattern:** Cold, clinical, speaks of their mission as inevitable duty
- **Notable Features:** Carries an extensive collection of notes and dossiers on their targets

## The Hunt

**Philosophy:** "Some knowledge is too dangerous to exist. Some power too corrupting to study."

**Methods:**

- Tracks correspondence between researchers and practitioners
- Maintains detailed records of every demon and corrupt practitioner
- Eliminates not just the dangerous individuals, but anyone who possesses related knowledge
- Views even healing research as "potential corruption manuals"

**The Dossiers:** Carries an extensive collection including:

- Known demon names, feeding patterns, last sightings
- Lists of martial artists who've shown signs of emotional corruption
- Researchers who've studied forbidden arts (Master Shun was on this list)
- Theoretical weaknesses and containment methods
- Master Shun's complete research archive (kept as reference for hunting targets)

## Kythara Entry

**Name:** Kythara the Divided 
**Classification:** Primal Emotion Demon (Fractured) 
**Last Confirmed Sighting:** Centuries ago during the Rune Wars
**Status:** Unknown - presumed destroyed or dormant 
**Feeding Pattern:** Hunts primal emotions (fear, rage, survival instincts) and nurturing emotions (love, protection, care) 
**Unique Traits:** Reported to exhibit contradictory behavior patterns 
**Weaknesses:**
- Theoretical - emotional balance disruption?
- The Light
- Split personality - needs further investigation
**Notes:** "Conflicting reports suggest this entity may have been damaged during the magical catastrophes. Verify current existence before engagement."

## Current Mission

**Recent Activities:**

- Eliminated Master Shun for researching emotional cleansing techniques
- Tracking other members of Shun's correspondence network
- Investigating reports of unusual demon activity in Ionia
- Following leads on practitioners who've accessed dangerous knowledge

**The Mukai Problem:**

- Initially unaware of Mukai's existence or knowledge
- Will eventually detect the emotional resonance patterns around the party
- Plans to identify and eliminate him once the connection is discovered
- The presence of Rha/Aph will eventually trigger recognition of the Kythara dossier

## Methods & Abilities

**Demon Detection:** Can sense emotional manipulation techniques and demonic presence over time 
**Research Network:** Has contacts and informants across Runeterra who report suspicious activities 
**Combat Focus:** Specialized in fighting emotional manipulation - immune to fear effects, mental domination
**Relentless Pursuit:** Once a target is identified, will not stop hunting until eliminated

## GM Notes

**Reveal Timeline:**

- First appears as mysterious killer of Master Shun
- Later will discover Mukai and Rha/Aph and will study them
- It will test certain theroies about Rha/Aph about their split personality.
- If it figures out Aph can't fight it will use this and find a means to forcefully switch out Rha
- Eventually recognizes Rha/Aph as the fractured Kythara from their dossiers
- Final confrontation involves philosophical debate about necessary vs. dangerous knowledge
