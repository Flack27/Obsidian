## Quick Reference

**Status:** Alive (working as Guy's agent)
**Location:** [[Quathala Overview]] (manipulating Baron Roderick)
**Relationship:** Enemy (irritating schemer)
**Key Trait:** Slimy manipulator pretending to be loyal advisor

## Background

Matthias Cray is an advisor who works as [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]]'s agent to destabilize [[Quathala Overview]] and make it vulnerable to Guy's takeover. He presents himself as Baron [[Roderick Voss]]'s "trusted" advisor, but manipulates the Baron's paranoia and poor judgment to ensure the region appears weak and mismanaged. His goal is to make Guy's "stabilization" seem both necessary and legitimate.

## Appearance & Mannerisms

- **Age:** 35 years old
- **Race:** Human (Noxian commoner)
- **Appearance:** Sharp features with a thin smile that never reaches his eyes
- **Speech Pattern:** Honey-sweet words and false concern, often uses "my lord" and "very clever, my lord"
- **Notable Features:** Slimy smile and calculating eyes that never miss an opportunity

## Campaign Story

### Manipulation Phase (Current)

Triggers Roderick's paranoia, ensures he makes terrible decisions while keeping them technically legal

### The Military Advice (Ongoing)

Convinces Roderick NOT to request reinforcements:
- "Requesting troops shows weakness to the capital"
- "Other barons will see it as failure to maintain order"
- "Guy du Bas-Tyra is watching for any sign you can't hold your domain"
- "Better to solve local problems with local solutions"

### Stonewall Scheme (Chapter 1-2)

Probably suggested hiring "outsiders" rather than requesting military aid - makes Roderick look weak while keeping him compliant with Noxian law

### The Deed Encouragement (Chapter 2)

When Roderick has idea to give party the village deed instead of paying, Matthias encourages: "Very clever, my lord - reward their service without depleting the treasury!"

### Exposed (Potential)

Party may discover his true allegiance to Guy

## Manipulation Methods

- Constantly reminds Roderick that rivals are watching
- Suggests everyone wants to see him fail
- Makes requesting help seem like weakness

## Lore & Connections

- [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]] - His true master and employer
- [[Roderick Voss]] - The Baron he's manipulating
- [[Quathala Overview]] - The region he's helping destabilize
- [[Stonewall]] - Irrelevant to the larger plan, but he plays along

## GM Notes

**Simple Schemer:** He's not a complex villain - just an opportunist doing Guy's dirty work. Not particularly dangerous by himself, just irritating.

**Guy's Tool:** Guy sees him as useful but replaceable. Matthias knows this and is careful to stay valuable.

**Stonewall Irrelevance:** Matthias doesn't care about the village deed - it was never part of Guy's plan. He just encourages Roderick's "clever" idea because it shows poor judgment.

**The Real Goal:** Make Roderick appear weak and incompetent without making him openly rebellious. This lets Guy "stabilize" the region as a concerned neighboring power rather than staging a coup.

**Post-Guy:** When Swain takes over and Guy flees, Matthias loses his patron and becomes irrelevant. He's not important enough to pursue.

**Playing Both Sides:** If confronted, might try to claim he was "protecting Roderick" or "trying to help." He's a survivor who'll say whatever keeps him safe.
