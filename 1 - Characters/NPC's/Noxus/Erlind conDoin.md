## GM Notes

**Tragic Father Figure:** Erlind represents the best of what Noxus could be - strong but caring, tactical but honorable. His death shows the human cost of Guy's "noble" ambitions.

**Relationship with Bennar:** He appreciated that Bennar treated Anita with respect and shared her love of music. He saw past Bennar's common birth to his good character.

**Military Reputation:** Known for caring about his soldiers' lives, not just victories. His tactical decisions always considered minimizing casualties, which made him beloved.

**Guy's Justification:** Guy sees Erlind as "an obstacle to necessary political alliance." He doesn't intend to kill him, just use him as leverage, but his neglect and harsh prison conditions do the deed.

**Death Impact:** His death should be emotional catalyst for the party - especially Bennar. It shows that Guy's actions have real, devastating consequences for good people.
