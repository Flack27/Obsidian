## Quick Reference

**Status:** Alive (struggling with psychological trauma) 
**Location:** [[Quathala Overview]] (Duke's Palace) 
**Relationship:** Neutral/Ally (victim of generational manipulation) 
**Key Trait:** Gentle-hearted young Duke broken by his father's grief-driven abuse

## Background

Duke Roderick Voss is the tragic product of a broken family legacy. His father Borric Voss was once friends with [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]], until their bitter rivalry over a woman named Catherine destroyed their bond and set the stage for generational trauma.

Roderick was born from his father's loveless second marriage - Borric had lost his beloved first wife Catherine and their three sons, leaving him a broken man consumed by grief. Roderick grew up as a shy, sensitive boy who loved art, music, and architecture, but his father saw these interests as weakness and spent twelve years trying to "make him a better man or break him in the trying."

This constant psychological abuse from his father, combined with living in the shadow of his dead half-brothers and the beloved stepmother he never knew, severely damaged Roderick's psyche. When he became Duke after Borric's death in the Ionian war, he initially tried to be the leader his people needed, but the trauma manifests as waves of paranoia that grow stronger under stress - especially through [[Matthias Cray]]'s manipulation.

Deep down he remains a good person who genuinely wants to help his people, but his rational thinking becomes overwhelmed during paranoid episodes triggered by his childhood trauma.

## Appearance & Mannerisms

- **Age:** 26 years old
- **Race:** Human (Noxian nobility)
- **Appearance:** Tired face with dark circles, wild look during paranoia moments, but retains traces of gentle refinement
- **Speech Pattern:** Thoughts often elsewhere, talks about what's going on in his head, seeks constant reassurance from Matthias
- **Notable Features:** Switches between moments of clarity where his good nature shows through and periods of suspicious agitation triggered by trauma responses

## Campaign Story

### The Beautiful Vision (Current Obsession)

Roderick has become obsessively focused on transforming [[Quathala Overview]] into "the most beautiful city in Noxus." His grand vision includes covering all building walls with imported marble, creating elaborate gardens alongside every street, and installing a complex canal system flowing through the city. He plans to extend this beautification project to every town and settlement in his domain once Quathala is complete.

### Economic Crisis (Current Consequences)

To fund his beautification project, Roderick has dramatically raised taxes across his domain. The citizens grow increasingly restless as their basic needs are ignored in favor of expensive marble and ornamental canals. What should be civic improvements have become a burden that threatens the stability of his rule.

### Military Situation (Current Crisis)

The garrison was legitimately reassigned to the Ionian front during the war's escalation - standard Noxian practice where strength flows where it's needed. Quathala was left with only a skeleton force. This is defensible by Noxian standards, but Matthias manipulates Roderick into NOT requesting reinforcements by convincing him it would show weakness to rivals and that Guy du Bas-Tyra is watching for any sign he can't hold his domain.

### Stonewall Crisis (Chapter 1)

Hires party to investigate the village "plague" using "local solutions" rather than requesting military aid - doesn't want to appear weak

### The "Brilliant" Reward (Chapter 2)

After learning the mayor is dead and village destroyed, gives party ownership of Stonewall instead of gold payment:
- Saves money for beautification projects
- Looks generous (giving land!)
- Village seems worthless anyway
- Matthias encourages this ("Very clever, my lord!")

### Guy's Consolidation (Chapter 3)

While party is away, Guy completes his takeover of the region through "stabilization" - Roderick realizes too late he's been outmaneuvered

## Lore & Connections

- [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]] - His father's former friend turned enemy, now orchestrating his downfall (unknown to him)
- [[Matthias Cray]] - His manipulative "advisor" who deliberately triggers his trauma responses
- [[Quathala Overview]] - His inherited domain, forever tainted by his father's grief and broken dreams
- [[Stonewall]] - The village he gave away thinking it was worthless
- **Borric Voss** - His deceased father whose emotional abuse created his psychological damage
- **Catherine** - The stepmother he never knew but whose loss shaped his entire family's tragedy

## GM Notes

**Tragic Figure:** Roderick represents the generational impact of his fathers' ancient rivalry. He is a victim of circumstances beyond his control - both his father's grief-driven abuse and Guy's political manipulation through Matthias.

**Beautification Obsession:** Stems from his love of art and beauty (the very things his father despised in him) combined with desperate need to prove his worth. He genuinely wants to make Quathala beautiful, but has no sense of priorities or economic reality.

**The Deed Decision:** Shows Roderick's poor judgment even when he thinks he's being clever. He genuinely believes giving away a "worthless destroyed village" while saving money for marble is brilliant strategy.

**Recovery Potential:** If Matthias is removed and trauma addressed, Roderick might recover some competence. But by then, Guy's plans are already in motion and the damage is done.
