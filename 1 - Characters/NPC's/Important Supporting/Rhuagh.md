## Background

Rhuagh is an ancient silver dragon who has lived for millennia in the mystical forests of [[Ionia]]. as his final days grew near he was Influenced by [[Zilean]]'s subtle magic, and was drawn to the ancient pre-Noxian tunnels beneath the [[Immortal Bastion]], though he doesn't fully understand why this place felt "right" to him. He brought three chests of treasures with him, though he's unsure why he felt compelled to carry them - perhaps because they held special meaning to him over the millennia.

## The Three Treasures

**Chest of Wonders:** Magical items, rare gems, and artifacts - gifts for the other party members who sit his death watch

## Conversation Suggestions

### On His Death Watch

_"I have but hours remaining, and it is the way of my people to sit the deathwatch, but there are none of my kind near enough to call. I would ask thee to wait for my passing before thy leaving. Wilt thou?"_

### On Death and Acceptance

_"I have had all that one of my kind could hope for: health, mates, young, riches, and rest. These are all I have ever wanted, and I have had them. The death hour matters not - it is still the same."_

### The Final Bequest (to good-hearted party members)

_"Before I pass, I have gifts for thee. [To specific good-hearted member]: In this chest is a gift for thee. Thou mayest take whatever else here pleaseth thee, for I will have no use for any of it. But of all in this hall, that is what I wish thee to have."_

### To Marduun Specifically

"Marduun, thanks to thee for spending my last with me. In the box here is something for thee. Thou mayest not understand why it calls to thee now, but thy heart is good, and some things become clear only when the time is right."

### To Others

_Those party members who don't demonstrate genuine goodness may receive general access to treasures but won't be personally addressed or given specific meaningful gifts._

## Lore & Connections

- [[Valheru]] - Knows only ancient legends, they vanished eons before his time
- [[Ashen-Shugar]] - Would not recognize this name, sword's connection unknown to him
- [[Zilean]] - Influenced by his subtle time magic to come here
- [[Ionia]] - His true home and the location of his main hoard
- [[Immortal Bastion]] - His chosen final resting place

## GM Notes

**Death Scene:** Rhuagh should pass peacefully after the death watch and gift-giving, having spent his final hours in good company. His death marks a transition from political intrigue to mythic destiny for the party.

**The Death Watch:** This should be a solemn, meaningful scene where the party sits with the dying dragon for several hours, sharing stories and wisdom. The gifts come only at the very end.

**Specific Gift for Marduun:** The sword is meant specifically for him, though mechanically he can't use it yet. Rhuagh senses this connection but doesn't fully understand it - just knows "thou wilt understand in time."

**Future Hook:** His mention of leaving "most of my hoard in Ionia" sets up a potential future quest location if the party ever travels there.
