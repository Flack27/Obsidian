## Chapter 1

### Key Events

- **Baron Roderick's Hiring:** Young baron struggling to prove himself needs "outsiders" to investigate village crisis without requesting military aid
- **Travel:** Road to Stonewall dangerous - region undermanned due to garrison reassignment to Ionian front
- **Heavy storm:** Causes [[Amos Trask]]'s Ship to take heavy damage, ports in Stonewall hours before party arrives
- **Stonewall Discovery:** Abandoned village, void creatures, mysterious altar
- **Celesta's Deception:** [[Celesta]] asks for help, plays victim

- **Renegade Group:** Bandits causing problems in region - increased activity due to lack of patrols (200gp reward)
- **Lost Memento:** Refugee asks party to retrieve dead husband's belonging from Stonewall (earns villager reputation for Chapter 2)

### GM Notes

- Establish Celesta as sympathetic figure party wants to help
- Show consequences of undermanned region - bandits, lack of patrols, dangerous roads
- Roderick is trying to handle crisis without admitting he needs military support
- Matthias has been manipulating him to avoid requesting reinforcements ("shows weakness")
- Original reward was likely gold, but Roderick wants to avoid paying

## Chapter 2

### Key Events

- **Investigation Report:** Party returns to report village status - mayor dead, void creatures, village destroyed
- **Roderick's "Brilliant" Idea:** Gives party ownership of Stonewall instead of gold payment
  - Saves money for beautification projects
  - Looks generous (giving land!)
  - Village seems worthless anyway
  - Matthias probably encourages this ("Very clever, my lord!")

### GM Notes

- Final peaceful moment before political chaos begins

- **Departure for Capital:** Guy heads to Immortal Bastion to marry Anita and cement his position
- **Roderick's Situation:** Fully under Guy's control, realizes too late he's been outmaneuvered

### GM Notes

- Show Guy's competence and larger vision
