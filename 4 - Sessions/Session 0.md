### Critical Hits & Fails

**Critical Success (Natural 20):**

## Roleplay Expectations

### In-Character vs Out-of-Character

**Please maintain clear distinction:**

- Use different voices/accents for characters (if comfortable)?
- Speak in English when in-character?
- Use normal voice/Dutch for out-of-character discussion?
- Minimize table talk during intense roleplay/combat

### Combat Roleplay
