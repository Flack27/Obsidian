## Overview

**Date:** Late Spring 14
**Type:** Local Celebration
**Origin:** Pre-Noxian tradition

## Description

The Marble Moon Festival is an ancient pre-Noxian tradition celebrating the full moon that illuminates the marble quarry with an ethereal glow. The white marble reflects moonlight so brilliantly that miners could work through the night during this time. Originally a practical celebration of extended work hours, it evolved into a festival of light, stone, and craftsmanship.

## Traditional Celebrations

- **Marble Token Carving:** Craft small marble tokens as gifts for loved ones
- **Lantern Display:** The entire marble mine would be covered with Lanterns
- **Master's Display:** The foreman would create a marble statue that will be displayed at the city center for a year
- **Night Work:** Some miners would work through the bright night, honored by the community

## Cultural Significance

The festival was always small and personal - not grand like Noxian celebrations, but deeply meaningful to the tight-knit mining community. It honored both:
- **The Mountain:** That provided sustenance and livelihood
- **The Miners:** Generations of stoneworkers who shaped the marble

## Current Status

### Survivor Debate

The survivors are divided on reviving the tradition:

**For Revival:**
- Honors those lost in the attack
- Reclaims village identity beyond tragedy
- Connects new residents to Stonewall's heritage
- Shows the village is healing and moving forward

**Against Revival:**
- Too painful to celebrate while mourning
- Reminds them of better times now lost
- Feels wrong without the full community

### Party Involvement

If the party helps organize the first post-attack Marble Moon Festival, it could become a powerful healing moment for the community - a reclaiming of their identity beyond the Void attack.
#### Planning Requirements
- Convince key survivors (especially the foreman)
- Prepare quarry with lanterns
- Encourage marble token carving
