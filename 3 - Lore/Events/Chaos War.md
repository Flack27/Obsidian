## Description

The Chaos War represents the greatest conflict in Runeterra's ancient historyâ€”a titanic struggle between the ruling Valheru and the arriving Celestials for dominance over the young world. What began as a territorial issue escalated into a reality-rending war. The Valheru, driven by their natural urge for dominance, took up the challenge and united for the first time in their existence. They built a city containing their ultimate weapon: the Lifestone. This device would destroy all life on Runeterra to increase their power, but was intended as a last resort. Meanwhile, the newly arrived Celestials were still fighting among themselves over who would take which portfolio. While the war raged, the transforming Ashen-Shugar refused to participate. When the leading Valheru returned to activate the Lifestone, Ashen-Shugar killed his own kind. This delay gave the Celestials the time they needed to resolve their own conflicts, divide their roles, and ultimately work together to banish all Valheru to the Void.
