## Overview

**Date:** Mid Summer 5, 989 AN
**Location:** Ionia (Swain's coup occurs during the campaign)
**Outcome:** Complete restructuring of Noxian government

General Jericho Swain orchestrates a successful coup against Grand General Boram Darkwill during the Ionian campaign, killing him and seizing power. Swain establishes the Trifarix - a new ruling council that fundamentally reshapes Noxus.

## The Trifarix System

### Three Principles of Leadership

**The Principle of Vision** - Grand General Jericho Swain
- Strategic leadership and long-term planning
- Bonded with demon of secrets (Raum)

**The Principle of Might** - Hand of Noxus Darius
- Military strength and martial prowess
- Leads the Trifarian Legion

**The Principle of Guile** - The Faceless
- Identity unknown
- Espionage and intelligence operations

## Major Changes

### Political Restructuring
- Noble houses stripped of automatic political power
- Meritocracy established - "Strength above all" becomes literal policy
- Old imperial system abolished
- Regional governors must prove competence or be replaced

### Guy du Bas-Tyra's Exile
- All of Guy's carefully built power base becomes worthless overnight
- Crimes: Unauthorized expansion, imprisonment / death of [[Erlind conDoin]], building personal power base
- Sentenced to exile rather than execution (Swain values competence)
- Stripped of all titles, [[Basilich]] confiscated
- Flees to [[Ionia]] (Late Summer 10, 989 AN)

### Military Reforms
- Ionian war reassessed - strategic withdrawal from unwinnable positions
- Merit-based promotions only
- Focus on consolidation rather than endless expansion

## Impact on Campaign

### Quathala Region
- [[Roderick Voss]] likely removed for incompetence
- New administrator appointed based on merit
- Party will have to travel to the Immortal Bastion to prove themselves in order to retain ownership of [[Stonewall]]
- Region stabilizes under professional governance and return of garisson
