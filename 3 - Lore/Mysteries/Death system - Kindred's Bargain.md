### The First Minute - Natural Death

When your character dies, for the first **60 seconds** their spirit lingers in **The Gray Between** where Lamb and Wolf await.

**Your Choice:**

- **Accept Lamb's Arrow:** Peaceful passing. No pain, no struggle. Character moves on to the afterlife. Create a new character at the same level as the party.
- **Defy Wolf's Jaws:** Cling to life through sheer will. You remain in The Gray Between, fighting against death itself until someone resurrects you or 1 minute passes.

### Standard Resurrection (Revivify)

**Accept Lamb (Let Go):**

- You are ready to pass on, no regrets
- The resurrection spell **fails**
- You move peacefully to the afterlife
- Create a new character at the same level as the party

**Defy Wolf (Fight Back):**

- You reject death and fight for your life
- The spell **succeeds** - you return to your body
- **BUT** you must immediately face **Wolf's Hunt**

### Wolf's Hunt

**The Challenge:**

- Solo combat encounter scaled to your current abilities
- No help from party members - this is your trial alone
- You keep all your equipment and abilities
- Wolf adapts to your tactics - he knows your every move

**On Victory:**

- You return to life fully
- Gain a **Mark of the Hunt** - a scar/mark showing you've faced Wolf and survived
- Once per long rest, you can sense when death is near (advantage on initiative or danger sense)

**On Defeat:**

- Wolf devours your soul
- **You die instantly**
- Neither can be resurrected by normal means (see below)

### True Resurrection & Wish

These spells are so powerful they can pull back those who have already moved on.

**The Catch:**

- The dead have moved on - whether they accepted Lamb or not
- The caster **forces them back** against the natural order
- The returning soul and the caster must face **Wolf's Hunt** automatically
- If they fail, **both the caster and the target die** and Wolf devours both souls

**This means:**

- True Resurrection/Wish can revive even those consumed by Wolf previously
- But it's incredibly dangerous - the caster risks their own life
