## Core Concept

The Bard foresaw the same catastrophic futures that [[Zilean]] did, but took a different approach. Instead of sacrificing himself through possession, the Bard chose to subtly guide events by placing temporal anchors - ensuring the "right people" would be in the "right place" at the "right time." Bennar's chime is one such anchor, locking him (and by extension the party) into the optimal timeline branch.

## The Mountain Trio Incident

- **What Really Happened:** The Bard appeared during a moment of temporal instability caused by the Ionian war's magical chaos
- **The Chime's Creation:** Not found, but deliberately given - the Bard "dropped" it where [[Bennar Weivand]]would find it
- **Temporal Locking:** The chime anchored Bennar to the timeline where he survives, joins the party, and helps save the world
- **Current State:** Damaged from the explosion but still functional, creating the debuff as it works to maintain timeline stability

## How It Works

**Timeline Anchoring:**

- Prevents Bennar from dying in situations where he "should" have died
- Creates temporal "weight" - making their timeline more "real" than alternate possibilities
- As Ashen-Shugar awakens, the timeline becomes more crucial, so the chime works harder (more glowing/resonance)

## Mechanical Progression

### Phase 1: Broken State (Level 1)

**Current Debuff:**

- -2 DEX, -2 STR, -10 movement speed
- Chime is dull, cracked, barely functional
- Working overtime to maintain timeline stability without proper power source

### Phase 2: Slow Regeneration (Sword Found - Major Cosmic Event)

**Gradual Recovery:**

- Debuffs slowly fade over time as the chime repairs itself
- Chime visibly mends, cracks heal, glow returns
- +2 DEX, +2 STR

### Phase 3: True Awakening

**The Meep Transformation:**

- Chime cracks open like an egg, releases a small Bard Meep
- Meep becomes Bennar's familiar/companion
- Meep becomes stronger over time


## Thematic Connections

**Bennar's Guilt:** His explosion that "should have" killed him was actually necessary - the Bard knew he needed to survive and change, becoming the person who could help save the world

**Free Will vs Destiny:** Was Bennar chosen, or did the Bard simply ensure the timeline where Bennar makes the right choices?

**Music and Time:** The chime resonates with Bennar's musical abilities - rhythm and timing are fundamental to both music and temporal magic

**The Bard's Gambit:** While Zilean sacrificed himself in desperation, the Bard played a longer game - trusting in mortals to make the right choices when given the opportunity
