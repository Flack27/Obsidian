ASHEN-SHUGAR SAT upon his throne, oblivious to the dancers. The moredhel females had been chosen for their beauty and grace, but he was untouched by their allure. His mind’s eye was far away, seeking the coming battle. Inside, a strangeness, a hollow feeling without name, came into being.

_It is called sadness_, said the voice within.

Ashen-Shugar thought: Who are you to visit me in my solitude?

_I am that which you are becoming. This is but a dream, a memory._

Ashen-Shugar drew forth his sword and rose from his throne, bellowing his rage. Instantly the musicians stopped their playing. The dancers, servants, and musicians fell to the floor, prostrating themselves before their master. “I am! There is no dream!”

_You are but a remembrance of the past_, said the voice. _We are becoming one._

Ashen-Shugar raised his sword, then lashed down. The head of a cowering servant rolled upon the floor. Ashen-Shugar knelt and placed his hand in the fountain of blood. Raising fingers to his lips, he tasted the salty flavor and cried, “Is this not the taste of life!”

_It is illusion. All has passed._

“I feel a strangeness, an unease that makes me…it makes me…there is no word.”

_It is fear._

Ashen-Shugar again lashed out with his sword, and a young dancer died. “These things, they know fear. What has fear to do with me?”

_You are afraid. All creatures fear change, even the gods._

Who are you? asked the Valheru silently.

_I am you. I am what you will become. I am what you were. I am Tomas._
