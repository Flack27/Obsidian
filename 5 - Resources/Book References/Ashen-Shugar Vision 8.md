Galain withdrew, and Tomas listened. A distant voice grew louder.

—

“HAVE I ERRED?”

The hall echoed with the words, for now it was vacant, the servants having slipped away. Ashen-Shugar brooded upon his throne. He spoke to shadows. “Have I erred?”

_Now you know doubt_, answered the ever-present voice.

“This strange quietness within, what is it?”

_It is death approaching._

Ashen-Shugar closed his eyes. “I thought as much. So few of my kind lived beyond battle. It was a rare thing. I am the last. Still, I would like to fly Shuruga once more.”

_He is gone. Dead, ages past._

“But I flew him this morning.”

_It was a dream. As is this._

“Am I then also mad?”

_You are but a memory. This is but a dream._

“Then I will do what is planned. I accept the inevitable. Another will come to take my place.”

_So it has happened already, for I am the one who came, and I have taken up your sword and put upon your mantle; your cause is now mine. I stand against those who would plunder this world._

“Then am I content to die.”

Opening his eyes, he took one last look at his hall now cloaked in ancient dust. Closing them for the last time, the Ruler of the Eagles’ Reaches cast his final spell. His waning powers, still unmatched upon this world by any save the new gods, flowed from his tired body, infusing his armor. Smoky wisps wafted upward from where his body had rested, and soon only the golden armor, white tabard, shield, and sword of white and gold remained.

_I am Ashen-Shugar; I am Tomas._

TOMAS’S EYES OPENED, and for a moment he was confused to find himself in the glade. A strange passion grew within as he felt a new strength flowing throughout his being. In his mind rang a clarion call: I am Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru. I will destroy all who seek to plunder my world.

With a terrible resolve he left the glade, to find the place the dwarves had brought his enemies.
