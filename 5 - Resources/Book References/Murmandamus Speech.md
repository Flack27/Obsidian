At dawn a thunderous cheer erupted from the besieging host, a mixture of shouts, shrieks, the rattle of drums, and the blowing of horns. But instead of the anticipated attack, the van of the army opened and a large platform rolled forward. It was moved by the strength of a dozen giants, the tall hairy creatures pushing it effortlessly. Upon the platform rested a gold encrusted throne, upon which sat a single moredhel dressed in a short white robe. Behind him crouched a figure whose features were hidden by a bulky robe and deep hood. The platform came toward the wall at a leisurely pace.

Guy leaned forward, his arm resting upon the blue stones of the wall, while Arutha stood at his side, arms crossed. Amos shaded his eyes with his hands against the rising sun. The seaman spat over the wall. ‘I think we finally meet the grand high royal bastard himself.’

Guy only nodded. A company subcommander came up and said, ‘Protector, the enemy takes position opposite all sectors of the wall.’

‘Any attempt to reach the mountain redoubts?’ Guy indicated the section of cliff behind the citadel.

‘Armand reports only weak thrusts toward the outposts in the rocks. They seem unwilling to climb and fight.’

Guy nodded and returned his attention to the field. The platform halted and the figure on the throne stood. By some act of magic his voice filled the air, heard by everyone on the wall as if he were standing only a few feet away. ‘O my children,’ he said, ‘hear my words.’ Arutha looked at Amos and Guy in wonder, for this Murmandamus spoke music. The very sounds of his words were etched with the warmth of a lute’s melody. ‘We share the destiny of tomorrow. Stand in opposition to fate’s will and you risk utter destruction. Come, come. Let old differences be put aside.’

He signalled and a company of human riders came trotting up to stand behind him. ‘Here, can you see? With me already are those of your kindred who understand our destiny. I welcome all who will willingly serve. With me you shall find a place of greatness. Come, come, let us put aside the past. You are but my misguided children.’

Amos snorted. ‘My old pa was a scoundrel, but that’s an insult.’

‘Come, I welcome any who will join.’ His words were sweet, seductive and those on the walls exchanged glances, and unspoken questions.

Guy and Arutha looked about, and du Bas-Tyra said, ‘There’s art and power in his voice. Look, my own soldiers are thinking maybe they won’t have to fight.’

Amos said, ‘Ready catapults.’

Arutha stepped beside him. ‘Wait!’

‘For what?’ asked Guy. ‘So he can sap the resolve of my army?’

‘Stall for time. Time is our ally, and his enemy.’

Murmandamus shouted, ‘But those who oppose, those who will not stand aside and who block our march toward destiny, those shall be crushed utterly.’

Now, the tone of his voice carried a warning, a note of menace, and those upon the walls were visited by a feeling of utter futility. ‘I give you a choice!’ He stretched his arms away from his body, and his short white robe fell away, revealing a body of incredible power, with the purple dragon birthmark clearly seen. He wore only a white loincloth. ‘You may have peace and serve in the cause of destiny.’ Servants ran forward and quickly fitted his armour to his body: iron plates and greaves, chain and leather; a black helm, with the upswept wings of a dragon on either side. Then the human riders moved away, and behind, a full company of Black Slayers could be seen. They rode forward and assumed positions about Murmandamus. Murmandamus took up a sword and pointed it toward the wall. ‘But if you resist, you will be obliterated. Choose!’

Arutha whispered in Guy’s ear. At last the Protector shouted back, ‘I may not order any to quit the city. We must meet in volksraad. We will decide tonight.’

Murmandamus paused, as if the answer was unexpected. He began to speak but was interrupted by the serpent priest. With a curt gesture he silenced the priest. Turning back toward the wall, Arutha imagined he could see a smile below the eye guards of Murmandamus’s black helm. ‘I will wait. At first light tomorrow, open the gates of the city and come forth. You will be embraced as returning brethren, o my children.’ He signalled and the giants pulled back the platform. In a few moments he had vanished into the huge host.
