## Valors - The Universal Standard

**Used by:** Noxus, Demacia, Northern Valoran, Southern Freljord 
**Materials:** Gold, Silver, Bronze 
**Origin:** Pre-dates both Noxus and Demacia, originally forged in Northern Valoran

Valors are the most widely accepted currency across Runeterra. Each coin features one metal on each side with distinctive ridging patterns - Noxian and Demacian Valors use different ridge patterns to prevent counterfeiting and identify smugglers. Both nations store captured foreign Valors in their royal reserves as negotiation leverage.

**Exchange Rates:**

- 1 Gold Valor = 10 Silver Valors = 100 Bronze Valors

## Shuriman Securis - The Desert Gold

**Used by:** Shurima, some desert traders 
**Materials:** Pure Gold in varying sizes 
**Design:** All inscribed with Sun Disc imagery

Shurima's unique currency system uses pure gold coins in different sizes rather than mixed metals:

- **Full Securis** - Large gold coin (very valuable, not common for trade)
- **Half Securis** - Standard gold coin size
- **Quarter Securis** - Small gold piece
- **Eighth Securis** - Tiny gold chip

**Exchange Rates:**

- 1 Full Securis = 100 Gold Valors
- 1 Half Securis = 1 Gold Valor
- 1 Quarter Securis = 1 Silver Valor
- 1 Eighth Securis = 1 Bronze Valor

Outside Shurima, Full Securis are often treated as valuable gems rather than currency due to their rarity and pure gold content.

## Bilgewater Serpents - The Pirate's Choice

**Used by:** Bilgewater, Krakens (formerly Union of the Blue Flame) 
**Materials:** Gold, Silver, Bronze 
**Design:** Snake-themed imagery

Originally developed for maritime trade, Serpents have become the standard currency of Bilgewater and associated pirate organizations. The Krakens tax a portion of their gold trade to mint their own Serpents.

**Exchange Rates:**

- 1 Gold Serpent = 10 Silver Serpents = 100 Bronze Serpents
- Serpents exchange roughly 1:1 with equivalent Valors

## Piltovan Currency - The Precision Standard

**Used by:** Piltover, Zaun 
**Materials:** Gold, Silver, Bronze 
**Denominations:** Gold Hexes, Silver Cogs, Bronze Gears 
**Design:** Hextech-inspired geometric patterns

Piltover's currency reflects their technological advancement with precision-engineered coins featuring geometric designs. The naming convention (Hexes, Cogs, Gears) reflects their mechanical expertise.

**Exchange Rates:**

- 1 Gold Hex = 10 Silver Cogs = 100 Bronze Gears
- Generally equivalent to Valors in value

## Ionian Placids - The Platinum Premium

**Used by:** Ionia exclusively 
**Materials:** Platinum 
**Design:** Square coins with central holes, stamped with Placidium seal

Placids are the most valuable standard currency in Runeterra, made from Ionia's rare platinum deposits. The square design with central holes allows for efficient storage and transport. Ionians refuse to accept foreign currencies due to the difficulty of separating mixed metals.

**Value:** 1 Placid = approximately 10-15 Gold Valors (due to platinum rarity)
