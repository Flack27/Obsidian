## The Original Demon

Long ago, there existed a singular primal demon of balance - a being that embodied both the hunt and the harvest, predation and nurturing. This ancient demon fed on the complete emotional spectrum of primal life: the thrill of the hunt AND the satisfaction of the feast, the terror of prey AND the protection of offspring.

## The Great Sundering

During the **Rune Wars**, when wild magic tore across Runeterra and reality itself became unstable, this primal demon was caught in a massive magical catastrophe. The chaotic energies didn't destroy the demon, but **fractured its essence** into opposing aspects:

- **Rha** - The Hunt: Retained the predatory instincts, aggression, survival emotions
- **Aph** - The Heart: Gained the nurturing, protective, social emotions

## The Unnatural Division

This fracturing was **unnatural** and **incomplete**. Neither half can exist properly without the other:

- Rha feels the constant absence of purpose beyond hunting
- Aph experiences emotions but lacks the strength to act on them meaningfully
- Both are drawn to reunification but don't understand what they're missing
