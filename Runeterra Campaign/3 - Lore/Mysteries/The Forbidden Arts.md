Dark Hado is a forbidden art that **weaponizes raw emotion**, similair to Shadow arts - both your own and others'. Unlike normal martial arts that focus on physical technique, Dark Hado practitioners learn to:

- **Channel their own primal emotions** (rage, fear, desperation) into devastating attacks
- **Manipulate others' emotions** during combat (instill terror, drain confidence, amplify pain)
- **Feed on emotional energy** released during intense moments (combat, death, suffering)

## The Power Source

Dark Hado draws from the **same emotional spectrum that demons feed on**, but approaches it differently:

**Demons:**

- Naturally consume emotions from their environment
- Are sustained by emotional energy
- Don't control the process - they simply feed

**Forbidden Arts Practicioners:**

- Artificially tap into emotional energy through technique and meditation
- Learn to store and weaponize this energy
- Become more demon-like the deeper they go

## Why It's Dangerous

**Progressive Corruption:**

1. **Beginner Level:** Enhanced strength/speed when angry, basic emotional sensing
2. **Intermediate Level:** Feeding on others' pain/death to restore energy, emotional vampirism
3. **Master Level:** Essentially becomes a demon - needs to feed on emotions to survive

**The Addiction:** The more you use it, the more you need it. Intermediate practitioners lose the ability to feel satisfaction from normal emotions and need increasingly intense experiences.

## [[Master Shun]]'s Research

**The Connection Discovery:** Shun realized that Dark Hado practitioners were **accidentally mimicking demon feeding patterns**. His research focused on:

- Why some martial artists naturally developed these abilities
- The connection between emotional martial arts and demon summoning/binding
- Whether demons were created by humans who went too far down this path
- **Most importantly:** Whether the process could be reversed
