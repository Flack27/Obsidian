## The Palace Years

When Guy du Bas-Tyra and Borric Voss were young men, they were both sent to the Immortal Bastion to receive the education befitting future Noxian barons. Guy was three years younger than Borric, who was barely eighteen, but they were of similar temperament and quickly became close friends. Over the years they gambled, trained, and studied together under the tutelage of Grand General Boram Darkwill's court.

Despite their friendship, they had fundamental differences. Borric was a frontier noble's son, more concerned with concepts of honor and duty, while Guy had been raised in eastern court politics and understood the true mechanisms of power from an early age.

## Catherine's Arrival

When Borric was called away for half a year to attend urgent family business in Quathala, a young woman named Catherine arrived at court to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Grand General Boram's wife. She was golden-haired with a shy smile and natural grace that immediately caught Guy's attention.

For the full six months of Borric's absence, Guy courted Catherine. What began as formal court attention developed into genuine affection between them. Though nothing was official, they had formed an understanding - Guy had even written to his father asking him to intercede for Catherine's hand in marriage.

## Borric's Return and Betrayal

When Borric returned to the Immortal Bastion, he fell in love with Catherine at first sight. The two friends began competing fiercely for her attention, their rivalry growing so bitter that they stopped speaking to each other.

However, Borric had learned well from Guy's earlier lessons in court politics. While Guy continued traditional courtship - riding and walking in gardens with Catherine - Borric went directly to Grand General Boram Darkwill himself. Recognizing the political value of binding the southern baron to his regime, Boram directed Catherine to wed Borric as her guardian.

## The Duel and Consequences

When Guy discovered the betrothal, he fell into a rage and challenged Borric to a duel within the palace itself. They fought with swords and nearly killed each other - Borric still bore the scar from under his left arm across his ribs from Guy's blade, and Guy carried a similar wound.

When Guy recovered from his injuries, Borric was already a week gone to Quathala, taking Catherine with him as his wife. The Grand General forbade Guy from following on pain of death.

## Catherine's Fate

Borric and Catherine had three sons together, but Catherine died giving birth to the youngest. Borric was devastated by her loss and never recovered from the grief. The tragedy deepened when all three sons died before reaching manhood - some from the plague, others in accidents, one in his first campaign.

Truly broken by these losses, Borric became a shadow of his former self. His advisors eventually pressured him to remarry for the sake of producing an heir to Quathala. He took another wife, but felt nothing for her - possibly even hatred, as he constantly compared her to his beloved Catherine.

## Roderick's Burden

From this loveless marriage came Roderick Voss. The boy was shy and sensitive, drawn to beautiful things like art, music, and architecture - qualities that disgusted his father, who saw them as weakness. Borric spent the next twelve years trying to either "make Roderick a better man" or break him in the attempt.

The psychological abuse from his father, combined with the weight of living in the shadow of his dead half-brothers and beloved stepmother he never knew, severely damaged Roderick's mind. This constant emotional trauma manifested as the "curse" of paranoia that now plagues him as an adult.

## Guy's Path

After losing Catherine, Guy threw himself into military campaigns with reckless abandon, hoping to die in battle. His reputation as a brilliant but ruthless general was forged in this period of grief and rage. Much of his later ambition and political maneuvering stems from this foundational loss - having lost the woman he loved to political marriage, he became determined to master the very system that had defeated him.
