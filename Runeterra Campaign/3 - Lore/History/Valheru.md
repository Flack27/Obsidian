## Description

The Valheru are an ancient and supremely powerful race capable of traveling through the cosmos on the backs of dragons. Born from Aurelion Sol long before Runeterra was created, they are beings of pure pragmatism who experience no emotions as mortals understand themâ€”no fear, love, or attachment. They see worlds as temporary dwellings and regard themselves as elevated above all other life forms. Their arrogance is so complete that they believe they are all that truly matters in the universe.

## Lore Points

- Born from Aurelion Sol but exist independently of the Celestials, dating from before Runeterra's formation by eons
- Completely emotionless beings who operate on pure logic and self-interest, regard themselves as the pinnacle of all existence
- Were the first inhabitants of Runeterra alongside the Vastaya, ruled the world long before humans or other mortal races arrived
- Kept the Vastaya as slaves for their pleasure, bred them like cattle for their utility and beauty
- When the Celestials arrived, the Valheru went to war out of pure dominance drive - they wanted to maintain their claim on the world
- Were willing to sacrifice the world via the Lifestone if they were threatened with defeat, because if they were to die it didn't matter if the universe still existed
- In their arrogance they believed they were all that truly existed - without them the universe had no meaning
- Only one Valheru, [[Ashen-Shugar]], chose to go against this philosophy by stopping the Lifestone activation
- Travel between worlds as easily as mortals travel between cities, connected to mighty dragons as their mounts through the cosmos
