## Quick Reference

**Status:** Dead (killed by [[The Severing Hand]]) 
**Location:** His monastery in northeastern Ionia 
**Relationship:** Ally ([[Mukai]]'s deceased master) 
**Key Trait:** Scholar-monk who studied dangerous arts to find their cure

## Background

Master Shun was a respected martial arts teacher who discovered that several of his former students had been corrupted by emotional manipulation techniques. Rather than simply forbidding these practices, he dedicated himself to understanding them - believing that knowledge of the corruption was necessary to heal it. 

## The Research Project

**Core Question:** Can emotional corruption be reversed, or only prevented?

**The Dangerous Knowledge:** His private research chamber contained:

- Detailed analysis of corruption patterns in former practitioners
- Technique notes (recorded "for reference only" to understand what he was fighting)
- Letters from other Masters and forbidden art practitioners describing their own struggles
- Theoretical frameworks for "emotional cleansing" rituals

## The Fatal Discovery

**The Correspondence:** His letters to other masters researching similar problems eventually drew attention from those who believed such knowledge was too dangerous to exist.

**[[The Severing Hand]]'s Mission:** They saw Shun's research as a manual for corruption, regardless of his healing intentions. His monastery was attacked not for harboring dangerous practitioners, but for harboring dangerous knowledge.

**The Final Stand:** [[The Severing Hand]] killed Shun not just for his research, but because they believed he himself had become "contaminated" by studying these techniques. To them, anyone who possessed this knowledge - even for healing purposes - was too dangerous to live. Shun died believing that destroying this knowledge would doom future victims to remain corrupted forever.
