## Background

Celesta was once a Celestial, but was captured in the Void and slowly corrupted by the Watchers. Now she serves as their agent to open a portal through which they can enter Runeterra. Celesta came to Stonewall to open the altar and claim Keth'vyss' weapon, but was defeated by the [[Zilean]]/[[Keth'vyss]] fusion. Now she recovers in the altar while posing as the protective deity that the villagers worshipped.

- **Speech Pattern:** Speaks with divine authority but with underlying manipulative tone

## Campaign Story

### First Encounter (Session 1)

When party investigates the altar and "meets" her as Keth'var

### Deception Phase (Ongoing)

While she recovers and manipulates the party to help her, will give boons to win their trust.

### True Revelation (Future)

When her true identity is revealed

## Lore & Connections

- [[Watchers]] - Her corruptors and masters
- [[Stonewall]] - Her current hideout
- [[Keth'vyss]] - The Darkin she needs for her plan
- [[Zilean]] - Defeated her in the earlier confrontation
- [[Ashen-Shugar]] - Feels instinctive hatred toward his essence

## GM Notes

**Deception Strategy:** Presents herself as Keth'var the Protector who was attacked by the "evil Darkin." Asks the party for offerings and help restoring her strength.

**Recovery Process:** Consumes monster parts, magical items, and power sources that the party brings. Gradually becomes stronger.

**Ultimate Goal:** Wants to assimilate Keth'vyss to gain enough strength to open massive Void portals. Her endgame is to bring the [[Valheru]] now [[Watchers]] back to Runeterra.

**Instinctive Hatred:** Her hatred toward Ashen-Shugar stems from the Watchers' rage over their defeat in the Chaos War, though she doesn't understand this herself.

**Future Fusion:** Eventually she will fuse with Keth'vyss when the opportunity presents itself, making her the final boss.
