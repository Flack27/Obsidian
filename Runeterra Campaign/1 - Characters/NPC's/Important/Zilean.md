**Key Trait:** Sacrificial chronomancer whose desperate gamble set everything in motion

## Background

Zilean is an ancient chronomancer with the power to look through time and see possible futures. When he received fragmentary and contradictory visions of Celesta's plan to destroy the world, he realized that all traditional solutions would fail. In the chaos of overlapping timelines, he glimpsed something - a connection between ancient powers and mortal inheritance that might offer hope. With time running out, he made one desperate intervention: using his time magic to subtly influence a dying silver dragon to seek the ancient tunnels beneath the Immortal Bastion as its final resting place. Then he immediately sacrificed himself, letting Keth'vyss take over his body to defeat Celesta and buy time, desperately hoping his tiny intervention would somehow develop into salvation.

## GM Notes

**The Desperate Gambit:** Zilean's visions were fragmented and contradictory due to the temporal paradox. He couldn't see a clear path, only glimpses that something involving ancient powers might be important. His only concrete action was influencing the dragon's final choice of resting place - a tiny intervention that he prayed would somehow matter.

**The Dragon's Compulsion:** The silver dragon felt drawn to the ancient tunnels beneath the Immortal Bastion without understanding why. Even the dragon doesn't fully comprehend what led it there - it simply "felt right" to make that place its final resting place.

**Liberation and Discovery:** When freed from Keth'vyss, Zilean will sense the Bard Chime's temporal influence on Bennar and realize someone else was working parallel to his plan. He'll count himself "incredibly lucky" not knowing it was the Bard's superior design.

**Timeline Study:** After liberation, Zilean will study the timeline to understand how his desperate gamble worked so perfectly. He'll discover the temporal paradox but won't fully grasp it until Marduun (now mostly Ashen-Shugar) explains it to him.

**The Missing Memories:** Zilean will sense that Marduun doesn't have full access to Ashen-Shugar's memories. The most crucial ones about the Lifestone, the Watchers' true nature, and why they hate Ashen-Shugar are mysteriously locked away.

**The Great Revelation:** Using his temporal magic, Zilean will unlock these suppressed memories, showing the party the complete story of the Valheru war, the Lifestone's creation, and Ashen-Shugar's betrayal of his own kind - setting up the final confrontation with Celesta.

**Complete Possession:** Zilean has little to no control over his body. He cannot break through or truly fight against the Darkin.

**Temporal Instability:** His struggle against Keth'vyss may have caused the very temporal ripples that made his plan possible - another layer of the paradox he couldn't foresee.
