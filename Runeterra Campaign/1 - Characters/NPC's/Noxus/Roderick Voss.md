## Quick Reference

**Status:** Alive (struggling with psychological trauma) 
**Location:** [[Quathala Overview]] (Duke's Palace) 
**Relationship:** Neutral/Ally (victim of generational manipulation) 
**Key Trait:** Gentle-hearted young Duke broken by his father's grief-driven abuse

## Background

Duke Roderick Voss is the tragic product of a broken family legacy. His father Borric Voss was once friends with [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]], until their bitter rivalry over a woman named Catherine destroyed their bond and set the stage for generational trauma.

Roderick was born from his father's loveless second marriage - Borric had lost his beloved first wife Catherine and their three sons, leaving him a broken man consumed by grief. Roderick grew up as a shy, sensitive boy who loved art, music, and architecture, but his father saw these interests as weakness and spent twelve years trying to "make him a better man or break him in the trying."

This constant psychological abuse from his father, combined with living in the shadow of his dead half-brothers and the beloved stepmother he never knew, severely damaged Roderick's psyche. When he became Duke after Borric's death, he initially tried to be the leader his people needed, but the trauma manifests as waves of paranoia that grow stronger under stress - especially through [[Matthias Cray]]'s manipulation.

Deep down he remains a good person who genuinely wants to help his people, but his rational thinking becomes overwhelmed during paranoid episodes triggered by his childhood trauma.

## Campaign Story

### The Beautiful Vision (Current Obsession)

Roderick has become obsessively focused on transforming [[Quathala Overview]] into "the most beautiful city in Noxus." His grand vision includes covering all building walls with imported marble, creating elaborate gardens alongside every street, and installing a complex canal system flowing through the city. He plans to extend this beautification project to every town and settlement in his domain once Quathala is complete.

### Economic Crisis (Current Consequences)

To fund his beautification project, Roderick has dramatically raised taxes across his domain. The citizens grow increasingly restless as their basic needs are ignored in favor of expensive marble and ornamental canals. What should be civic improvements have become a burden that threatens the stability of his rule.

### Military Deficiency (Current Crisis)

Dismissed his loyal commandant in a fit of rage when the man tried to warn him that the citizens were suffering and the beautification taxes were too high. This criticism of his beloved project sent Roderick into a fit of rage accusing the commandant of "treason" and firing him on the spot. When the entire garrison followed their respected leader rather than serve under Roderick's increasingly erratic rule, it left Quathala completely defenseless. 

### Party Contract (Session 1)

Hires party to investigate the Stonewall "plague", offering the village's land deed as payment - unknowingly playing into Matthias' manipulation to transfer territory to Guy's control. Views this as a minor distraction from his real work of making Quathala beautiful.

## Lore & Connections

- [[Guy du Bas-Tyra]] - His father's former friend turned enemy, now orchestrating his downfall (unknown to him)
- [[Matthias Cray]] - His manipulative "advisor" who deliberately triggers his trauma responses
- [[Quathala Overview]] - His inherited domain, forever tainted by his father's grief and broken dreams

- **Borric Voss** - His deceased father whose emotional abuse created his psychological damage
- **Catherine** - The stepmother he never knew but whose loss shaped his entire family's tragedy

## GM Notes

**Tragic Figure:** Roderick represents the generational impact of his fathers' ancient rivalry. He is a victim of circumstances beyond his control - both his father's grief-driven abuse and Guy's political manipulation through Matthias.

**The "Curse":** Roderick's paranoia isn't supernatural but psychological trauma from his father's emotional abuse. Borric's constant attempts to "toughen him up" broke something fundamental in Roderick's ability to trust and think clearly under pressure.

**Guy's Unknowing Cruelty:** Guy doesn't realize he's psychologically torturing the son of his former best friend. To Guy, Roderick is just another weak noble to be manipulated - he doesn't see Borric's broken boy grown up.
