## GM Notes

**Music Passion:** Her love of music represents her desire to be part of something bigger than noble society. She sees the rhythm and coordination of military music as beautiful and powerful.

**Relationship with Bennar:** Started as friendship over shared musical interest, but developed into deeper connection. She saw past his common birth to his talent and character.

**Guy's Target:** Guy wants to marry her for political alliance with her father's military connections and to legitimize his position. He sees her as a political tool, not a person.

**Escape Motivation:** She's not just running from marriage - she's trying to save her father and protect what she believes in. She has agency and courage.

**Future Role:** After her father's death, she could become a recurring ally, providing inside knowledge of Noxian politics and military structure.

**Emotional Arc:** Her journey from protected noble daughter to someone who loses everything and must find her own strength parallels the party's growth.
