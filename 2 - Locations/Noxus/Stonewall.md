## Description

Stonewall was a peaceful farming village with predominantly Shuriman heritage. The village was built around an ancient stone altar that the villagers believed protected them through their local deity "Keth'var the Protector." Since the Noxian expansion, the village falls under Noxus, but the inhabitants have retained their Shuriman traditions. Now the village stands abandoned after a terrifying night when Void creatures emerged from the altar.

## Notable Locations

**The Ancient Altar** A massive stone structure in the village center, originally dedicated to the Ascended [[Keth'vyss]] but now corrupted. The altar currently stands open and reveals a dark passage leading downward. [[Celesta]] resides here in her recovery state and claims to be the protective deity. Void creatures still occasionally emerge from the depths.

**Abandoned Homes** Small farming houses scattered around the village center, hastily abandoned during the evacuation. Personal belongings still lie scattered, and some houses show signs of Void corruption. Perfect for setting up a party base once they are cleared.

**The Old Mill** A windmill on a small hill overlooking the village. It offers a good vantage point for observing the surroundings and could serve as a watchtower for the party's future operations.

**The Shrine Path** A stone path leading from the village entrance directly to the altar, lined with small offering stones. The villagers used this route for their daily prayers and offerings to "Keth'var."

## Current Situation

**Void Corruption**

- Dark energy seeps from the opened altar into the environment
- Strange creatures occasionally emerge and require constant vigilance
- The corruption spreads slowly but can be contained with effort

**[[Celesta]]'s Presence**

- She has claimed the altar as her domain and recovery sanctuary
- Presents herself as the village's protective deity seeking help
- Uses the abandoned offerings from the villagers and all items the party brings for her restoration

**Cultural Legacy**

- Shuriman artifacts and texts are left behind in the houses, valuable for research
- Traditional Shuriman farming techniques had made the land fertile
- Ancient family shrines in homes show devotion to Shuriman ancestors

**Future Potential**

- With cleanup and protection, it could become an ideal party stronghold
- Central location for regional operations and investigation
- Rich farmland could support future settlement growth
- The altar could possibly be purified or at least contained
- The Shuriman heritage could attract new settlers who respect the culture
