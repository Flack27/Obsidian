## Description

Stonewall was a small riverside village nestled against a mountain, built around a productive marble mine. The village existed primarily to support the mining operations that supplied high-quality marble to [[Roderick Voss]]'s domain, particularly for his beautification projects in [[Quathala]]. With a population of around 150 people, it was a tight-knit community of miners, farmers, and craftspeople. Now the village stands abandoned and partially destroyed after a devastating night when Void creatures emerged, killing most inhabitants and forcing the survivors to flee.

## Pre-Disaster Population & Economy

**Total Population:** ~150 people

**Primary Industry - Marble Mining:**
- 20 skilled miners working the mountain mine
- High-quality white/gray marble prized by nobles
- Supplied Roderick's beautification projects
- Mining families comprised ~60 people total

**Secondary Industry - Agriculture:**
- 15 farmers working fertile fields east of the river
- Subsistence farming with modest surplus for trade
- Farming families comprised ~50 people total

**Support Services:**
- Blacksmith (tool repairs, mining equipment)
- Carpenter (building maintenance, mine supports)
- Inn/Tavern ("The Miner's Rest")
- Dock master managing river trade
- Small merchant operating general store
- 5 hunters who doubled as town protection
- Support workers and families: ~30 people

**Trade:** Regular shipments of marble downriver to Quathala, with return goods and supplies.

## The Disaster & Current Status

**The Attack:**
A Void rift opened beneath the village during the night. Creatures emerged from both the mine's deep tunnels and an ancient shrine passage, catching the sleeping village completely unprepared. Most residents were killed in their homes or in the panicked evacuation. The few who escaped fled into the night with nothing but what they carried.

**Current Survivors:** ~20-21 people
- **In Quathala:** 5-6 healthy adults who reached safety
- **Roadside Camp:** ~15 people (families with children, elderly, wounded) hiding in a makeshift camp between Stonewall and Quathala, too afraid or unable to complete the journey

**Casualties:** ~130 people killed or missing
- **Confirmed Dead:** Mayor (killed in initial attack), Ship Captain (died defending the docks)

## Notable Locations

**The Marble Mine**
A massive operation carved into the mountainside, Stonewall's economic heart. 

**River Dock**
Small but functional dock on the river where marble was loaded for transport to Quathala. [[Amos Trask]]'s damaged ship arrived here just hours before the party, now burning at the dock.

**Residential District**
Scattered houses, most damaged or destroyed. Personal belongings lie abandoned. The eastern section near the farms is in better condition than the western section near the mine.

**Agricultural Fields**
Fertile farmland on the eastern riverbank, now overgrown but salvageable. Includes small orchards and vegetable plots.

**The Ancient Shrine**
Hidden in the forest west of the river, accessible by an overgrown path. An ancient Shuriman shrine carved directly into the mountainside, featuring weathered reliefs of a warrior figure with portal imagery. A small offering table sits before the carved entrance. 

The shrine was mostly forgotten except by village elders who occasionally left offerings. Inside, a passage leads deep into the mountain - the same passages the Void creatures used to reach the surface. The shrine entrance is sealed and can only be opened by speaking the pass phrase: **"Nehg-moh-lee"** (Ancient Shuriman ).

**Current Void Corruption**
- Dark energy pulses from the sealed shrine
- The corruption spreads slowly but steadily
- Village center heavily affected, outer areas less so
