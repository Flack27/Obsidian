## Core System

### **Resources to Track**

1. **Population** (current number of villagers)
2. **Housing Capacity** (max villagers you can house)
3. **Morale** (scale of 1-10)
4. **Marble blocks** (20 GP / Block)
5. **Buildings** (what exists and their levels)
6. **Workers Assigned / Available** (population % 2)

### **1 Turn = 1 Month**

- Each month roll a d100 to see if a event happens

### **Party Assistance**

- If a party member assists in the construction of a building for the full duration the cost of that project is reduced by 50%
	- 2 party members are needed to upgrade a building to level 2
	- 3 party members are needed to upgrade a building to level 3

## Morale System

### **Morale Scale: 1-10**

### **Morale Effects**

**Low Morale (1-3):**

- Recruitment: Disadvantage on checks
- Risk: Each turn, roll d20. On 1-5, lose 1d6 villagers (they leave)

**Normal Morale (4-7):**

- Everything functions normally

**High Morale (8-9):**

- Recruitment: Advantage on checks
- Growth: +1d4 villagers arrive each turn

**Excellent Morale (10):**

- Recruitment: Advantage on checks
- Growth: +1d6 villagers arrive each turn
- Advantage on all checks related to village or villagers

### **Morale Modifiers** (Calculated each turn)

**Automatic Modifiers:**

- **Housing**: Shortage (more people than capacity) **-1** / Surplus (10+ empty spaces) **+1**
- **Food**: Shortage (can't feed everyone) **-1** / Surplus (can feed 10+ more) **+1**
- **Leadership**: Leader absent 1+ turns **-1** / Leader present **+1**
- **Security**: Recent loss defending village (last 4 turns) **-2** / Recent victory defending village **+2**

**Party Actions** (DM discretion, temporary bonuses lasting 1-4 turns)
